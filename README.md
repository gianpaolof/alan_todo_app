A todo app with Alan AI smart voice assistant android application. Experience a hands-free voice app where you can add, edit, delete and make the voice assistant read items in your todo list. This repository is an end product of the todo app. Fork the repository and modify the code to build yout own version of Todo. To learn the step by step process of building this application, refer my blog (link to be added soon).

## How to run the app?
Follow the below steps to test the application on your device:

### Step 1: Fork the repository
Forking the repository will create a copy of the repository in your gitHub where you can add custom features and build a different version of the app for yourself. You can also, contribute to the template by suggesting necessary changes through issues.


### Step 2: Clone your repository
After forking the repository head over to your copy and fork clone the repository in your local system. Open the project with Android Studio. Your JDK version might mismatch, so select "Use Embedded JDK" when prompted in android studio.

### Step 4: Sign up on Alan Studio
After the build is successful, sign up to [Alan Studio](https://studio.alan.app/) and create a project to get the API key. Alan provides APIs for our android application to enable voice assistant. Paste the API key in your project and run the application.

### Step 5: Import Alan script files
Download the Alan Script files from the repository and import them in Alan Studio.

### Step 6: Run the app
After completing all the above steps, run the application from Android Studio on either your emulator or your Android device.

You can add more functionality in the app and make your own version of it. For step by step guidance to create an attractive and amazing User Interface, User experience and voice experience, follow my [blog page](https://venusaim.hashnode.dev/) (articles to be added soon).
